# **App Name**: Playwright to Robot Converter

## Core Features:

- File Path Selection: Provides browse buttons for selecting the Excel mapping file, Playwright Python file/folder, and output Robot file folder.
- Code Conversion: Converts Playwright (Python) code to Robot Framework test cases based on the mapping in the Excel file.
- Path Persistence: Saves and loads file paths (Excel mapping file, input Python file/folder, and output Robot file folder) to/from a default_paths.json file, pre-filling the input fields on application startup.

## Style Guidelines:

- Implement a background gradient using colors like #B2DFDB to #80CBC4 for a visually appealing aesthetic.
- Use a secondary color palette of #FFFFFF for primary text and #424242 for secondary text to ensure readability against the gradient background.
- Accent colors like #26A69A should be used for interactive elements (buttons, links) to make them stand out.
- Use a modern, sans-serif font like 'Roboto' or 'Open Sans' for a clean and readable UI. Ensure a variety of font weights are used to establish hierarchy.
- Adopt a flexible, grid-based layout to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes. Utilize media queries to adjust the layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- Incorporate a set of minimalistic icons from libraries like FontAwesome or Material Icons for actions like 'Browse', 'Convert', and 'View'. These icons should be visually consistent and intuitive.
- Add subtle transitions and animations to interactive elements to provide feedback and enhance the user experience. For example, buttons could slightly change color on hover.
